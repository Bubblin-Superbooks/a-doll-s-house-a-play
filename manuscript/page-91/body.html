<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nora. You? Do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run a risk to save your wife's life?</p><p>Krogstad. The law cares nothing about motives.</p><p>Nora. Then it must be a very foolish law.</p><p>Krogstad. Foolish or not, it is the law by which you will be judged, if I produce this paper in court.</p><p>Nora. I don't believe it. Is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her dying father anxiety and care? Is a wife not to be allowed to save her husband's life? I don't know much about law; but I am certain that there must be laws permitting such things as that. Have you no knowledge of such laws--you who are a lawyer? You must be a very poor lawyer, Mr. Krogstad.</p></div> </div>
