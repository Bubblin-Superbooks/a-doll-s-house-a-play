You haven't any idea how many expenses we skylarks and squirrels have, Torvald.</p><p>Helmer. You are an odd little soul. Very like your father. You always find some new way of wheedling money out of me, and, as soon as you have got it, it seems to melt in your hands. You never know where it has gone. Still, one must take you as you are. It is in the blood; for indeed it is true that you can inherit these things, Nora.</p><p>Nora. Ah, I wish I had inherited many of papa's qualities.</p></div> </div>
