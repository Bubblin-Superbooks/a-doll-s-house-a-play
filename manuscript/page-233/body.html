<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nora. Thank you for your forgiveness. [She goes out through the door to the right.]</p><p>Helmer. No, don't go--. [Looks in.] What are you doing in there?</p><p>Nora [from within]. Taking off my fancy dress.</p><p>Helmer [standing at the open door]. Yes, do. Try and calm yourself, and make your mind easy again, my frightened little singing-bird. Be at rest, and feel secure; I have broad wings to shelter you under. [Walks up and down by the door.] How warm and cosy our home is, Nora. Here is shelter for you; here I will protect you like a hunted dove that I have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating heart. It will come, little by little, Nora, believe me. Tomorrow morning you will look upon it all quite differently; soon everything will be just as it was before.</p></div> </div>
