<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Helmer. How unreasonable and how ungrateful you are, Nora! Have you not been happy here?</p><p>Nora. No, I have never been happy. I thought I was, but it has never really been so.</p><p>Helmer. Not--not happy!</p><p>Nora. No, only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But our home has been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife, just as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the children have been my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they thought it great fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage has been, Torvald.</p></div> </div>
