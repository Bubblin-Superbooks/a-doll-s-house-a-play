[Puts the bag of macaroons into her pocket and wipes her mouth.] Come in here, Torvald, and see what I have bought.</p><p>Helmer. Don't disturb me. [A little later, he opens the door and looks into the room, pen in hand.] Bought, did you say? All these things? Has my little spendthrift been wasting money again?</p><p>Nora. Yes but, Torvald, this year we really can let ourselves go a little. This is the first Christmas that we have not needed to economise.</p><p>Helmer. Still, you know, we can't spend money recklessly.</p></div> </div>
