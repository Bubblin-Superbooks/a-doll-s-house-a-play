Does it not occur to you that this is the first time we two, you and I, husband and wife, have had a serious conversation?</p><p>Helmer. What do you mean by serious?</p><p>Nora. In all these eight years--longer than that--from the very beginning of our acquaintance, we have never exchanged a word on any serious subject.</p><p>Helmer. Was it likely that I would be continually and forever telling you about worries that you could not help me to bear?</p><p>Nora. I am not speaking about business matters.
