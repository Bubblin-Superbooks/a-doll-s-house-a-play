<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nora. Torvald, I don't believe you mean that.</p><p>Helmer. Don't you? Why not?</p><p>Nora. Because it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.</p><p>Helmer. What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am narrow-minded?</p><p>Nora. No, just the opposite, dear--and it is exactly for that reason.</p><p>Helmer. It's the same thing. You say my point of view is narrow-minded, so I must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very well--I must put an end to this. [Goes to the hall door and calls.] Helen!</p></div> </div>
