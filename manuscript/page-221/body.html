Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's blood, and everything, for your sake.</p><p>Nora [disengages herself, and says firmly and decidedly]. Now you must read your letters, Torvald.</p><p>Helmer. No, no; not tonight. I want to be with you, my darling wife.</p><p>Nora. With the thought of your friend's death--</p><p>Helmer. You are right, it has affected us both. Something ugly has come between us--the thought of the horrors of death. We must try and rid our minds of that. Until then--we will each go to our own room.</p></div> </div>
