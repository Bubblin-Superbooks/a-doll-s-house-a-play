I believe you, if you say so. But now that you know it, are you not going to give it up to me?</p><p>Mrs Linde. No, because that would not benefit you in the least.</p><p>Krogstad. Oh, benefit, benefit--I would have done it whether or no.</p><p>Mrs Linde. I have learned to act prudently. Life, and hard, bitter necessity have taught me that.</p><p>Krogstad. And life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches.</p></div> </div>
