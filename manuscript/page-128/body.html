We ought to be so well off, so snug and happy here in our peaceful home, and have no cares--you and I and the children, Torvald! That is why I beg you so earnestly--</p><p>Helmer. And it is just by interceding for him that you make it impossible for me to keep him. It is already known at the Bank that I mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is it to get about now that the new manager has changed his mind at his wife's bidding--</p><p>Nora. And what if it did?</p><p>Helmer. Of course!--if only this obstinate little person can get her way!

I should very soon feel the consequences of it, I can tell you!</p></div> </div>
