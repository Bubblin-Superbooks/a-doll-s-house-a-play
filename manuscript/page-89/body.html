Let me ask you a question; why did you not send the paper to your father?</p><p>Nora. It was impossible; papa was so ill. If I had asked him for his signature, I should have had to tell him what the money was to be used for; and when he was so ill himself I couldn't tell him that my husband's life was in danger--it was impossible.</p></div> </div>
