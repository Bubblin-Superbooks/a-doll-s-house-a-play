And I have to thank you for all this--you whom I have cherished during the whole of our married life. Do you understand now what it is you have done for me?</p><p>Nora [coldly and quietly]. Yes.</p><p>Helmer. It is so incredible that I can't take it in. But we must come to some understanding. Take off that shawl. Take it off, I tell you. I must try and appease him some way or another. The matter must be hushed up at any cost. And as for you and me, it must appear as if everything between us were just as before--but naturally only in the eyes of the world. You will still remain in my house, that is a matter of course. But I shall not allow you to bring up the children; I dare not trust them to you.</p></div> </div>
