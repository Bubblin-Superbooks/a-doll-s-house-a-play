Well, let me look. [Turns to go to the letter-box. NORA, at the piano, plays the first bars of the Tarantella. HELMER stops in the doorway.] Aha!</p><p>Nora. I can't dance tomorrow if I don't practise with you.</p><p>Helmer [going up to her]. Are you really so afraid of it, dear?</p><p>Nora. Yes, so dreadfully afraid of it. Let me practise at once; there is time now, before we go to dinner. Sit down and play for me, Torvald dear; criticise me, and correct me as you play.</p></div> </div>
