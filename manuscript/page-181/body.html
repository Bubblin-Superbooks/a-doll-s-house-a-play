You should have let it alone; you must prevent nothing. After all, it is splendid to be waiting for a wonderful thing to happen.</p><p>Mrs Linde. What is it that you are waiting for?</p><p>Nora. Oh, you wouldn't understand. Go in to them, I will come in a moment. [Mrs Linde goes into the dining-room. NORA stands still for a little while, as if to compose herself. Then she looks at her watch.] Five o'clock. Seven hours until midnight; and then four-and-twenty hours until the next midnight. Then the Tarantella will be over. Twenty-four and seven? Thirty-one hours to live.</p></div> </div>
