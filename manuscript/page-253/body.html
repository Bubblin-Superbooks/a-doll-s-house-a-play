Perhaps--if your doll is taken away from you.</p><p>Helmer. But to part!--to part from you! No, no, Nora, I can't understand that idea.</p><p>Nora [going out to the right]. That makes it all the more certain that it must be done. [She comes back with her cloak and hat and a small bag which she puts on a chair by the table.]</p></div> </div>
