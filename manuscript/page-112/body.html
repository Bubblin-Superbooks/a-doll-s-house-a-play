There is no one else out there, is there? How good of you to come!</p><p>Mrs Linde. I heard you were up asking for me.</p><p>Nora. Yes, I was passing by. As a matter of fact, it is something you could help me with. Let us sit down here on the sofa. Look here. Tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy-dress ball at the Stenborgs', who live above us; and Torvald wants me to go as a Neapolitan fisher-girl, and dance the Tarantella that I learned at Capri.</p></div> </div>
