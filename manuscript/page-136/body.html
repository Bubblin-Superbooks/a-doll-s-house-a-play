<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nora [gripping him by the arm]. What have you found out? Doctor Rank, you must tell me.</p><p>Rank [sitting down by the stove]. It is all up with me. And it can't be helped.</p><p>Nora [with a sigh of relief]. Is it about yourself?</p><p>Rank. Who else? It is no use lying to one's self. I am the most wretched of all my patients, Mrs Helmer. Lately I have been taking stock of my internal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall lie rotting in the churchyard.</p><p>Nora. What an ugly thing to say!</p><p>Rank. The thing itself is cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is that I shall have to face so much more that is ugly before that. I shall only make one more examination of myself; when I have done that, I shall know pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will begin. There is something I want to tell you.</p></div> </div>
