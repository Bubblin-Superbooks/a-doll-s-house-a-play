But, tell me, was it really something very bad that this Krogstad was guilty of?</p><p>Helmer. He forged someone's name. Have you any idea what that means?</p><p>Nora. Isn't it possible that he was driven to do it by necessity?</p><p>Helmer. Yes; or, as in so many cases, by imprudence. I am not so heartless as to condemn a man altogether because of a single false step of that kind.</p></div> </div>
