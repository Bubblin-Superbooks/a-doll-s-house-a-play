[Walking about the room.] It's perfectly glorious to think that we have--that Torvald has so much power over so many people. [Takes the packet from her pocket.] Doctor Rank, what do you say to a macaroon?</p><p>Rank. What, macaroons? I thought they were forbidden here.</p><p>Nora. Yes, but these are some Christine gave me.</p><p>Mrs Linde. What! I?--</p><p>Nora. Oh, well, don't be alarmed! You couldn't know that Torvald had forbidden them. I must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my teeth. But, bah!--once in a way--That's so, isn't it, Doctor Rank? By your leave! [Puts a macaroon into his mouth.] You must have one too, Christine. And I shall have one, just a little one--or at most two. [Walking about.] I am tremendously happy. There is just one thing in the world now that I should dearly love to do.</p></div> </div>
