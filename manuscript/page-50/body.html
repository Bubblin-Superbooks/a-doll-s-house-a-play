<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p> Very well, I thought, you must be saved--and that was how I came to devise a way out of the difficulty--</p><p>Mrs Linde. And did your husband never get to know from your father that the money had not come from him?</p><p>Nora. No, never. Papa died just at that time. I had meant to let him into the secret and beg him never to reveal it. But he was so ill then--alas, there never was any need to tell him.</p><p>Mrs Linde. And since then have you never told your secret to your husband?</p><p>Nora. Good Heavens, no! How could you think so? A man who has such strong opinions about these things! And besides, how painful and humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly independence, to know that he owed me anything! It would upset our mutual relations altogether; our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now.</p></div> </div>
