<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Krogstad. Do you mean that you will--?</p><p>Nora. I have courage enough for it now.</p><p>Krogstad. Oh, you can't frighten me. A fine, spoilt lady like you--</p><p>Nora. You will see, you will see.</p><p>Krogstad. Under the ice, perhaps? Down into the cold, coal-black water? And then, in the spring, to float up to the surface, all horrible and unrecognisable, with your hair fallen out--</p><p>Nora. You can't frighten me.</p><p>Krogstad. Nor you me. People don't do such things, Mrs Helmer. Besides, what use would it be? I should have him completely in my power all the same.</p></div> </div>
