Listen--the guests are beginning to go now. [In a lower voice.] Nora--soon the whole house will be quiet.</p><p>Nora. Yes, I hope so.</p><p>Helmer. Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you know, when I am out at a party with you like this, why I speak so little to you, keep away from you, and only send a stolen glance in your direction now and then?--do you know why I do that? It is because I make believe to myself that we are secretly in love, and you are my secretly promised bride, and that no one suspects there is anything between us.</p></div> </div>
