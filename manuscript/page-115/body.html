When you have three children, you get visits now and then from--from married women, who know something of medical matters, and they talk about one thing and another.</p><p>Mrs Linde [goes on sewing. A short silence]. Does Doctor Rank come here everyday?</p><p>Nora. Everyday regularly. He is Torvald's most intimate friend, and a great friend of mine too. He is just like one of the family.</p><p>Mrs Linde. But tell me this--is he perfectly sincere? I mean, isn't he the kind of man that is very anxious to make himself agreeable?</p></div> </div>
