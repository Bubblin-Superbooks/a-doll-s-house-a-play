<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Nora [rising]. Oh, don't be angry with me!</p><p>Mrs Linde [going up to her]. It is you that must not be angry with me, dear. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter. No one to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for chances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me of the happy turn your fortunes have taken--you will hardly believe it--I was delighted not so much on your account as on my own.</p><p>Nora. How do you mean?--Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps Torvald could get you something to do.</p></div> </div>
