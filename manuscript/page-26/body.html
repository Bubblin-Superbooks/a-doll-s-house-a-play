<div class="leaf flex"><div class="inner justify"><p>Helmer. Do you remember last Christmas? For a full three weeks beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight, making ornaments for the Christmas Tree, and all the other fine things that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever spent!</p><p>Nora. I didn't find it dull.</p><p>Helmer [smiling]. But there was precious little result, Nora.</p><p>Nora. Oh, you shouldn't tease me about that again. How could I help the cat's going in and tearing everything to pieces?</p><p>Helmer. Of course you couldn't, poor little girl. You had the best of intentions to please us all, and that's the main thing. But it is a good thing that our hard times are over.</p></div> </div>
